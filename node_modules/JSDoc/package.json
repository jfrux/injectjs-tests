  "readme": "JSDoc 3\n=======\n\nAn inline API documentation processor for JavaScript. JSDoc 3 is intended to be\nan upgrade to JsDoc Toolkit (JSDoc 2).\n\n### Pull Requesters: Please read HOW_TO_CONTRIBUTE.md \n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nDownload a copy of JSDoc 3 from the official Git Hub repository here:\n<https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc>\n\nTo test that jsdoc is working, change your working directory to the jsdoc folder\nand run the following command on Windows:\n\n    jsdoc -T\n\n... or on a Max OSX or *nix platform:\n\n    ./jsdoc -T\n\nIf you can't get the short-form commands to work, try invoking Java directly:\n\n    java -cp lib/js.jar org.mozilla.javascript.tools.shell.Main \\\n    -modules nodejs_modules -modules rhino_modules -modules . \\\n    jsdoc.js -T\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nThis example assumes that your working directory is the jsdoc application base\ndirectory:\n\n    ./jsdoc yourSourceCodeFile.js\n\nFor help regarding the supported commandline options use the --help option.\n\n    ./jsdoc --help\n\nGenerated documentation will appear in the folder specified by the --destination\noption, or in a folder named \"out\" by default.\n\nDependencies\n------------\n\nJSDoc 3 utilises the Mozilla Rhino engine, which requires Java. JSDoc 3 is known\nto work with version 1.6.0_24 of Java.\n\nJSDoc 3 uses advanced features in the Rhino application which are only\navailable in or after the 1.7 release 3. A copy of this version of Rhino is\nincluded in JSDoc so this is not normally an issue that the user needs to be\nconcerned with. However, in rare cases, users may have their Java CLASSPATH\nconfigured to override that included Rhino and point to some older version of\nRhino instead. If this is the case, simply correct the CLASSPATH to remove the\nolder Rhino.\n\nThe version of rhino distributed with JSDoc3 can be found here:  https://github.com/jannon/rhino\n\nDebugging\n---------\n\nRhino is not always very friendly when it comes to reporting errors in\nJavaScript. Luckily it comes with a full-on debugger included that can be much\nmore useful than a simple stack trace. To invoke JSDoc with the debugger try the\nfollowing command:\n\n    jsdoc --debug\n\nor the long form version:\n\n    $ java -classpath lib/js.jar \\\n    org.mozilla.javascript.tools.debugger.Main -debug \\\n    -modules nodejs_modules -modules rhino_modules -modules . \\\n    jsdoc.js \\\n    your/script.js\n\nNote: ```--debug``` must be the first argument to the short form command\n\nThis will open a debugging window. Choose \"Break on Exceptions\" from the \"Debug\"\nmenu, then press the \"Run\" button. If there is an error, you should see exactly\nwhere it is in the source code.\n\nSee Also\n--------\n\nProject Documentation: <http://usejsdoc.org/> (under development)  \nProject Documentation Source: <https://github.com/micmath/micmath.github.com>  \nJSDoc User's Group: <http://groups.google.com/group/jsdoc-users>  \nJSDoc3 Ant Task <https://github.com/jannon/jsdoc3-ant-task>  \nProject Annoncements: <http://twitter.com/jsdoc3>\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nJSDoc 3 is copyright (c) 2011 Michael Mathews <micmath@gmail.com>\n\nSee file \"LICENSE.md\" in this distribution for more details about\nterms of use.",
